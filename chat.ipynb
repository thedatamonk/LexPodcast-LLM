      "\n",
      "1. According to Elon Musk, it is looking quite likely that Tesla will solve level four FSD (Full Self-Driving) next year.\n",
      "2. The solution to the full self-driving problem will involve the current pool of FSD beta candidates gaining greater degrees of autonomy.\n",
      "3. The probability of an accident on FSD must be less than that of the average human, and significantly lower before Tesla would consider it safe enough to release to the public. Tesla aims for at least two or three times higher safety than a human.\n",

      "1. Elon Musk believes that the problem of autonomous driving is solvable and has a strong intuition that it is tractable, according to Andrej Karpathy.\n",
      "2. The team at Tesla is making significant progress towards solving the problem of autonomous driving, as stated by Andrej Karpathy.\n",

      "According to the context provided, Elon Musk believes that Tesla is \"looking quite likely\" to solve level four FSD (Full Self-Driving) next year, which implies that self-driving will be \"completely solved\" when they achieve level four autonomy.\n",
      "However, it's important to note that the context doesn't provide a specific year, so we can only infer that it's \"next year\" from the perspective of when the podcast was recorded.\n",
      "Additionally, the safety margins mentioned (at least two or three times higher safety than a human) also need to be achieved before Tesla would consider it safe enough to release to the public.\n"

She emphasizes the difficulty in measuring and understanding consciousness and raises questions about applying the concept of consciousness to AI or other entities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aella shares her experiences of being homeschooled and isolated due to her father's controlling nature. She discusses how she lost her faith and started questioning her beliefs, eventually feeling safer with her newfound beliefs despite the possibility of online backlash.\n",

      "In discussing dancing, Aella shares her experiences and enjoyment of various dance styles, emphasizing the challenge of solving a rapid puzzle while dancing and the importance of sensitivity and communication between dance partners.\n",
      "\n",
